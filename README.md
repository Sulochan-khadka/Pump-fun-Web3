Pump.fun is a platform on the Solana blockchain that allows users to create and trade "memecoins"â€”a type of cryptocurrency associated more with community and entertainment than intrinsic utility. Known for its ease of use, Pump.fun enables anyone to create a custom token by connecting a Solana-compatible wallet, setting up a coin name, symbol, and supply, and minting it on the blockchain.
